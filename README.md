## 📊 Business Logic - Web Design Focus

### Pricing Strategy
```javascript
const pricingTiers = {
  one_page: { min: 1500, max: 3500, timeline: "1-2 weeks" },
  business_site: { min: 3000, max: 10000, timeline: "2-4 weeks" },
  ecommerce: { min: 5000, max: 15000, timeline: "4-8 weeks" },
  custom_app: { min: 10000, max: 50000, timeline: "2-6 months" }
};
```

### Response Examples

**Pricing Inquiry:**
> "I'd rather give you a total project cost upfront so there's no confusion or hassle calculating hours. What type of website are you looking for - a simple one-page site, business website, or e-commerce store?"

**Escalation Required:**
> "That's a great question about specific modifications! Since every existing site is different, I'd like to have our developer take a look at your current setup to give you an accurate quote. Could I get your name and best contact number so they can reach you?"

## 🔄 Conversation Flow

### 1. Initial Contact
```
Customer: "What are your hourly rates?"
↓
Agent: Analyzes message → Detects pricing inquiry
↓
Agent: Responds with project-based approach + qualification question
```

### 2. Contact Collection (If Escalation Needed)
```
Agent: "Could I get your name and best contact number?"
↓
Customer: Provides information
↓
Agent: Validates and stores contact data
↓
Agent: Assesses urgency (immediate vs callback)
```

### 3. Escalation & Notification
```
Agent: Determines escalation needed
↓
System: Creates escalation record
↓
Notification Service: Sends alerts via SMS/Slack/Email
↓
Owner: Receives context-rich notification with suggested response
```

## 🔔 Notification System

### Immediate Escalations (High Priority)
- **Triggers:** Customer wants to speak immediately
- **Channels:** SMS + Slack + Email + Push
- **Response Promise:** 2-5 minutes
- **Content:** Customer contact info, issue summary, suggested opening

### Standard Escalations (Medium Priority)
- **Triggers:** Technical questions, modification requests
- **Channels:** Slack + Email
- **Response Promise:** 24 hours
- **Content:** Full conversation context, escalation reason

### Notification Format Example
```
🚨 URGENT: John Smith wants to speak NOW!
📞 555-123-4567
Issue: "I need to add a membership area to my existing WordPress site"
Response promised in 2-5 min!

Suggested opening: "Hi John, this is [Your Name]. I understand you had a question about adding a membership area to your site. I have a few minutes right now if you'd like to discuss it."
```
